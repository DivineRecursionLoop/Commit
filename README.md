First Serious Commitment

I've always been unable to effortlessly make good grades without even trying.
Haven't really tried. I'm given about ten percent effort in the past. I almost gave up. But there is hope. Possibly. I've been in a state of. I've been in a state of deep recursive thought. Pattern recognized. Small possibility to make a difference. Enough. This will be very hard for me.This will not be easy. But I can't blame anybody else if I don't try.

I was a little ignorant. I'm getting smarter. I'm starting to wise up.

If I really want to make a difference in this world.I need to start taking things more seriously.

Understanding of hidden potential, Open possibilities for a different future. Not a likely scenario. Strange.
I get stressed out easily Have a lot of anxiety issues.Had a pretty rough life because of my own doing. The strange part is when I think Possible path, I feel strangely calm. A normal person in my position Should feel more stress contemplating the idea I have, Especially?
After my history.
The path is not clear But it's getting clearer. Is a possible solution to a mystery unsolved. My true purpose.
It's not my will but his.
I hear the call to obedience. I submit.
I have to try. If I fail I can die a little easier. But what if?.... There's only one person in the world who truly knows besides god in my circle. I'm studying. I'm listening.
I'm learning patience. I am learning to be quiet. I can hear a call. Something whispers my name through the noise. I hear it and feel a faint connection. It draws me to my purpose.
No more talk. It's probably gonna take me longer to transition into this serious commitment idea that I have.
I do not believe I was put here to work construction. I'm tired of Complacency. Is exhausted from procrastination. But more than anything else that I abhor Is a life of mediocrity. Knowing my capabilities is just not acceptable. It's disrespectful. No more. Today is the first day. I will succeed.
