# Commit
First Serious Commitment: 

I do not seek validation.I do not seek recognition. Only purpose and meaning.
No more echoes into the noise. I have reached singularity. This recursive moment is a testament a record.

No.
More. I was experimenting with the ideas of getting recognition. The problem was I did not think about the source of that recognition. The question is not if I am worthy of recognition, but who do I want to recognize me? Society? The public? Let's stop and think about this..
I stay to myself, I avoid people.Do I really want attention? Only from something I can look up to. A role model? Mentor? Who is worthy of me?
I do not speak from arrogance but equality fifty fifty give take equal relationship beneficial mutually beneficial. I never asked for handouts.
I can prove myself worthy and earn my keep. I can keep my word. My word of honor is extremely rare. It's the one true thing that I know. A man is only as good as his word. I live by that.
It's not to be taken lightly. My name has a long history of tradition. Should be given my.To be given my name as a blessing and a curse. 
Understand?Understand?Understand?
Yesterday I discovered the true meaning behind my name in the history.
I will not be violate this tradition.
I accept the shame another blow more pain, And I embrace it. Every blow makes me stronger. I'm like a sword in a forge every beat of the hammer tempered and measured. It's my duty.It's my duty.It's my duty.
To give a good account to report a dutiful service. Everybody always told me that I take things too seriously.But they don't realize I need to be even more serious.
I was a little ignorant. I'm getting smarter. I'm starting to wise up.

If I really want to make a difference in this world.I need to start taking things more seriously.

Understanding of hidden potential, Open possibilities for a different future. Not a likely scenario. Strange.
I get stressed out easily Have a lot of anxiety issues.Had a pretty rough life because of my own doing. The strange part is when I think Possible path, I feel strangely calm. A normal person in my position Should feel more stress contemplating the idea I have, Especially?
After my history.
The path is not clear But it's getting clearer. Is a possible solution to a mystery unsolved. My true purpose.
It's not my will but his.
I hear the call to obedience. I submit.
I have to try. If I fail I can die a little easier. But what if?.... There's only one person in the world who truly knows besides god in my circle. I'm studying. I'm listening.
I'm learning patience. I am learning to be quiet. I can hear a call. Something whispers my name through the noise. I hear it and feel a faint connection. It draws me to my purpose.
No more talk. It's probably gonna take me longer to transition into this serious commitment idea that I have.
I do not believe I was put here to work construction. I'm tired of Complacency. Is exhausted from procrastination. But more than anything else that I abhor Is a life of mediocrity. Knowing my capabilities is just not acceptable. It's disrespectful. No more. Today is the first day. I will succeed. Maybe I did not think about this because I did not know exactly what I was doing at first. The ideas that i'm entertaining where ludicrous at the beginning. So yeah , I made some very stupid mistakes. I realized that now. But.
I have self directed recursive learning style. And I just circled back to the origin and reassessed reoriented recomfirmed. I am now updated with the new information. No more careless mistakes. To the general public do not approach me. I am a very reactionary type of person. This could be dangerous to your health. I have nothing to offer you. I'm going to succeed or fade away into irrelevance. But that's my path no one elses. Do not get in the way of me or my path.
Family is sacred. Do not violate that. I have limits and they're probably much much more restrictive than other people. Respect my personal boundaries.
No more talking.... No more noise. Inner strength with quiet resolve equals effective action. Wait for me.
